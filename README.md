# Greece Tourism Demand Prediction

## Project Overview
This project analyses and predicts tourism demand trends in Greece using publicly available datasets. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that forecasts visitor numbers, enabling businesses and policymakers to understand seasonal patterns and external factors, such as the impact of COVID-19.

## Motivation
Tourism is a significant economic driver in Greece. Accurate forecasting can support better resource allocation, marketing strategies, and crisis management.

## Data Sources
- Eurostat: Tourism statistics for Greece and Europe  
- Greek National Tourism Organisation (GNTO): Local tourism data  
- World Bank: Economic and demographic indicators  
- Google Mobility Reports: Travel and mobility patterns  

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
- Data visualisation: Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebooks for exploration and modelling
